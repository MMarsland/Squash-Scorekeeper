# Squash Scorekeeper

**--ARCHIVED--**

This project was created as part of CU Hacking 2019.



The Squash Scorekeeper is a smartphone or laptop proof-of-concept for web-application that allowed users to keep track of their scores and serving positions while playing Squash. The project is written in Javascript, HTML and CSS and runs on devices in Google Chrome.

The application uses webkit speech recognition (which turned out very poorly) and all-in-all turned out lack luster, which is pretty fair for the 24 hour period I had and the fact that I was working alone and just starting out in web development.

Anyway, it was a good learning experience and the application is pretty funny to try and use.



## Development / Testing

To continue development or try the project out for yourself, clone or download the repository and open "main.html" in Google Chrome. (Other web browsers may work but are necessarily supported). You must allow the web page to access your microphone to use voice commands. Good Luck...
